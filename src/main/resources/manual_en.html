<h2>HandBag - User Guide</h2>
<p>
   HandBag is a light-weight GUI tool for manually assembling and transferring BagIt packaged content.
   It has a self-contained application binary for each major platform: Windows, Mac, and Linux
   and has no external dependencies (e.g. installing Java).   
</p>
<p>
HandBag has various advanced capabilities, such as profile-aware metadata constraints, fetch file
handling, etc. but all these features are optional, and not required to master for productive use of the tool.
HandBag employs a sensible set of default configuration values, and you will not
typically need to adjust (or even understand) them to perform basic activities.
</p>
<h3>Quick Start</h3>
Simply to collect a few payload files, add some descriptive metadata (using the reserved
metadata elements), then transfer the serialized bag to a destination, follow these easy steps:
<ol>
<li>Launch the application, which will open to the <em>Basic</em> settings tab.</li>
<li>Assign a name to the bag you are creating.</li>
<li>Enter or browse for a destination directory.</li>
<li>Switch to the <em>Payload</em> tab, and 'drag and drop' files from anywhere on the desktop to the
   area under the <em>data</em> folder icon.</li>
<li>Switch to the <em>Metadata</em> tab and enter or select desired information.</li>
<li>Press the <em>Destination</em> button to the right of the tabs.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="usecase">Primary Use-Case</h4>
      <p>HandBag is a tool for selecting resources from the local (or an accessible mounted) file system to be placed
   in a directory structure conforming to the BagIt specification, describing this resource set,
   and transferring/transmitting it to a local or remote destination, in a compressed package, or as a
   loose directory.
</p>
<p>Visually, the UI operates roughly from left to right, starting with the <em>Settings</em> tab, where you specify
   the minimum information (name for the bag, destination) necessary for a transfer. Next, you can select
   files from the file system, and drop them into the <em>Payload</em> tab area. Finally, the <em>Metadata</em> tab exposes
   a property editor where you can describe the bag. In fact, you may enter metadata or payload files in any order,
   moving back and forth across tabs.
</p>
   
<p>When the bag is complete, there are just two alternative actions to perform, using the buttons to the right of the
   tabs. You may either discard your work <em>(Trash)</em>, or press the <em>Destination</em> button to effect the transfer. Note that
   discarding the bag will <em>not</em> delete or remove any source files, so it is a safe operation. It merely clears your workspace
   to start another bag with a single button press.
</p>
<h4 id="basic_settings">Basic Settings</h4>
<p>
   HandBag makes extensive use of default configuration, to minimize the amount of repetitive manual
   entry needed to produce an application artifact (bag). In fact, only two values must be set:
   the bag name, and the destination. The bag name will be the filename preceding the suffix indicating the
   archive or compression type, or if using a loose directory, it will be the name of the top-level directory
   containing the bag. HandBag requires that the file or directory not exist, to prevent overwriting an existing
   bag of the same name, so a new name must be assigned for each new bag. We will see that there are even ways
   to automate the naming scheme using name macros - a topic for later exposition.
</p>
<p>
   The destination value can be either a directory in the accessible file system (hitting the
   <em>Browse</em> button brings up a directory chooser), or a URL to an Http address. In either case,
   the button label will change to <em>Clear</em>, which removes the destination. HandBag assumes there
   may be multiple bags transmitted to the same destination in a session of the application, so this field
   is not automatically cleared afer each use (as the bag name is, e.g).
</p>
<p>
   The final basic config value is labelled package format, which may be one of the supported serializatons,
   or <em>none</em> for a loose directory bag. Note that unserialized bags may not be transmitted to a remote 
   web service, only to the local file system.
