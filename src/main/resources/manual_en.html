<h2>HandBag - User Guide</h2>
<p>
   HandBag is a light-weight GUI tool for manually assembling and transferring BagIt packaged content.
   It has a self-contained application binary for each major platform: Windows, Mac, and Linux
   and has no external dependencies (e.g. installing Java).   
</p>
<p>
HandBag has various advanced capabilities, such as profile-aware metadata constraints, fetch file
handling, etc. but all these features are optional, and not required to master for productive use of the tool.
HandBag employs a sensible set of default configuration values, and you will not
typically need to adjust (or even understand) them to perform basic activities.
</p>
<h3>Quick Start</h3>
Simply to collect a few payload files, add some descriptive metadata (using the reserved
metadata elements), then transfer the serialized bag to a destination, follow these easy steps:
<ol>
<li>Launch the application, which will open to the <em>Basic</em> settings tab.</li>
<li>Assign a name to the bag you are creating.</li>
<li>Enter or browse for a destination directory.</li>
<li>Switch to the <em>Payload</em> tab, and 'drag and drop' files from anywhere on the desktop to the
   area under the <em>data</em> folder icon.</li>
<li>Switch to the <em>Metadata</em> tab and enter or select desired information.</li>
<li>Press the <em>Destination</em> button to the right of the tabs.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="operation">Operation</h4>
<p>
   HandBag is a tool for selecting resources from the local (or an accessible mounted) file system to be placed
   in a directory structure conforming to the BagIt specification, describing this resource set,
   and transferring/transmitting it to a local or remote destination, in a compressed package, or as a
   loose directory.
</p>
<p>
   Visually, the UI operates roughly from left to right, starting with the <em>Settings</em> tab, where you specify
   the minimum information (name for the bag, destination) necessary for a transfer. Next, you can select files
   from the file system, and drop them into the <em>Payload</em> tab area. Finally, the <em>Metadata</em> tab exposes
   a property editor where you can describe the bag. In fact, you may enter metadata or payload files in any order,
   moving back and forth across tabs.
</p>  
<p>
   When the bag is complete, there are just two alternative actions to perform, using the buttons to the right of the
   tabs. You may either discard your work <em>(Trash)</em>, or press the <em>Destination</em> button to effect the transfer. Note that
   discarding the bag will <em>not</em> delete or remove any source files, so it is a safe operation. It merely clears your workspace
   to start another bag with a single button press.
</p>
<h4 id="basic_settings">Basic Settings</h4>
<p>
   HandBag makes extensive use of default configuration, to minimize the amount of repetitive manual
   entry needed to produce an application artifact (bag). In fact, only two values must be set:
   the bag name, and the destination. The bag name will be the filename preceding the suffix indicating the
   archive or compression type, or if using a loose directory, it will be the name of the top-level directory
   containing the bag. HandBag requires that the file or directory not exist, to prevent overwriting an existing
   bag of the same name, so a new name must be assigned for each new bag. We will see that there are even ways
   to automate the naming scheme using name macros - a topic for later exposition.
</p>
<p>
   The destination value can be either a directory in the accessible file system (hitting the
   <em>Browse</em> button brings up a directory chooser), or a URL to an Http address. In either case,
   the button label will change to <em>Clear</em>, which removes the destination. HandBag assumes there
   may be multiple bags transmitted to the same destination in an application session, so this field
   is not automatically cleared afer each use (as the bag name is, e.g).
</p>
<p>
   The final basic config value is labelled package format, which may be one of the supported serializations,
   or <em>none</em> for a loose directory bag. Note that unserialized bags may not be transmitted to a remote 
   web service, only to the local file system.
</p>
<h4 id="payload">Payload</h4>
<p>
   The payload tab displays an initially empty <em>data</em> directory tree under the root of the bag. Adding
   files is simply accomplished by dragging the icon or name of a file (in any desktop app that lists files,
   e.g. an explorer) to under the data folder and dropping. You may also drag a directory, which will add all 
   the leaf node files directly under <em>data</em>, collapsing any directory sub-structure. You can, however,
   impose any directory structure you want: simply right-click when the cursor is on a directory node, and a
   context menu offers you the choice of creating a sub-directory ("Add folder"). The context menu is also
   available for files, where it has an action to remove the selected file. This could be used to drag a large
   directory, but exclude a few files from the bag. The fetch action will be discussed below. Note that the bag
   information display to the right of the tabs reflects the current size of the bag (payload files).
</p>
<h4 id="metadata">Metadata</h4>
<p>
   Bag metadata is typically recorded in the tag file <em>bag-info.txt</em>. The <em>Metadata</em> tab
   provides an editor to assign values to existing elements, and add new elements (fields) to the metadata set.
   Elements have attributes (such as being required) that are respected by the editor: one cannot transmit a bag
   with unassigned required fields. The editor also respects any installed <em>Bagit profiles</em>: it includes
   all specified elements (and their attributes), and if a value list is provided, the editor will restrict
   selections to the list values. Profile management is discussed below. As a convenience, above the element
   list in the editor is a box labelled <em>search</em>: it filters elements by their label, so you can quickly
   'zero in' on the elements you want to work with.
</p>
<h4 id="tagfiles">Tag Files</h4>
<p>
   Tag files are permitted anywhere in the bag except the payload directory (<em>data</em>). The tag file
   tab contains a directory tree (from the bag root) where drag-and-drop operations can be performed like
   those in the payload tab, including creating new directories and subdirectories.
</p>
<h4 id="fetch">Fetch Files</h4>
<p>
   Fetch files are payload files whose contents are not included in the bag. The fetch tab contains a ledger of
   such files, which is recorded in the bag as <em>fetch.txt</em>. To designate a fetch file, open the context
   menu on the flle in the payload tab, and enter a fetch URL.
</p>
<h4 id="profile">BagIt Profiles</h4>
<p>
   HandBag provides extensive support for the BagIt Profiles specification. Profiles encode capabilities and constraints
   on bags and their metadata. A given bag may, in fact, conform to multiple profiles, if they do not conflict with each
   other. HandBag embodies a 'stack/merge' model for profiles. All bags are subject to a base profile - known as the
   <em>platform</em> profile, which captures the underlying capabilities of the software application and dependent libraries
   - such as what versions of the BagIt spec are supported, what serializations can be encoded, etc. This profile is
   not user-accessible or modifiable, since it expresses hard limits of software functionality, not user preference.
</p>
<p>
   By default configuration (check-box on basic settings tab), a second profile (<em>reserved</em>) is stacked on the platform
   with the BagIt specification 'reserved' metadata element set. Finally, using the basic settings field labeled 'profile',
   you may add in (merge) any arbitrary profile by entering a URL or browsing in the local filesystem for a JSON-formatted document.
   Profile documents can be reached via dereference of the URL, which is the most typical use-case.
   If you wish to replace or discard a profile, just press the button labeled 'clear', which will 'pop' the last installed
   profile from the stack.
